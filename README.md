# while_loops

These are my solutions for the Try It Yourself exercises in chapter 7 of [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/) by Eric Matthes.

This chapter introduces the basics of using `input()` to capture user input and store into variables. We use `while` loops to run our programs as long as certain criteria is met using different methods to control the flow, such as setting an `active` flag. We iterate over lists and move items into other lists. We also iterate over dictionaries.
